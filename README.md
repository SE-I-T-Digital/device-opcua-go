# OPC-UA Device Service

## Overview

This repository is a Go-based EdgeX Foundry Device Service which uses OPC-UA protocol to interact with the devices or IoT objects.

## Feature

1. Subscribe data from OPCUA endpoint (TBD)
2. Execute read command
3. Execute write command
4. Execute method (using Read command of device SDK)

## Prerequisite

- Edgex-go: core data, core command, core metadata
- OPCUA Server

## Predefined configuration

### Pre-define Devices

Define devices for device-sdk to auto upload device profile and create device instance. Please modify `devices.toml` file found under the `./cmd/res/devices` folder

```toml
# Pre-define Devices
[[DeviceList]]
  Name = "SimulationServer"
  Profile = "OPCUA-Server"
  Description = "OPCUA device is created for test purpose"
  Labels = [ "test" ]
  [DeviceList.Protocols]
      [DeviceList.Protocols.opcua]
          Endpoint = "opc.tcp://node-red:55880/OPCUA/SimulationServer"
```

### Subscribe configuration

Modify `configuration.toml` file found under the `./cmd/res` folder if needed

```toml
# Driver configs
[OPCUAServer]
  DeviceName = "SimulationServer"   # Name of Devcice exited
  Policy = "None"                   # Security policy: None, Basic128Rsa15, Basic256, Basic256Sha256. Default: auto
  Mode = "None"                     # Security mode: None, Sign, SignAndEncrypt. Default: auto
  CertFile = ""                     # Path to cert.pem. Required for security mode/policy != None
  KeyFile = ""                      # Path to private key.pem. Required for security mode/policy != None
  NodeID = "ns=5;s=Counter1"        # Node id to subscribe to
```

## Devic Profile

A Device Profile can be thought of as a template of a type or classification of a Device.

Write a device profile for your own devices; define deviceResources and deviceCommands. Please refer to `cmd/res/profiles/OpcuaServer.yaml`

## Installation and Execution

```bash
make build
make run
```
